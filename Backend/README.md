# Niramaya AI Backend üåà

*Powering healthcare insights with a robust and secure API.* üåüüñ•Ô∏è

## Overview ‚ú®

The Niramaya AI backend is a scalable, Node.js-based server that powers the platform‚Äôs AI-driven healthcare insights. Built with Express.js, it handles user authentication, file uploads (lab reports and medicine images), OCR and PDF parsing, AI-powered text analysis via Meta Llama, and real-time chatbot interactions. Integrated with PostgreSQL for data storage and secured with JWT authentication, the backend ensures reliable, multilingual, and accessible health solutions for users worldwide. üöÄüòä

## Files üìã

The backend logic is organized conceptually into several key modules, though currently all code resides in `server.js`. Below are the primary components and their roles:

| **File**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **dbSetup.js** üóÑÔ∏è     | Initializes the PostgreSQL database, setting up tables for users (email, name, DOB, health records, counts) and activities (user actions, dates). Currently implemented as the `initDatabase` function in `server.js`. |
| **promptManager.js** ‚úçÔ∏è | Generates tailored prompts for Meta Llama, including medical summary prompts for lab reports and medicine insights, factoring in user age, language, and health records. Currently implemented as `generateMedicalSummaryPrompt` and `generateMedicineSummary` functions in `server.js`. |
| **llmHandler.js** ü§ñ   | Manages communication with the Meta Llama model via Together AI, sending prompts and chat history to generate AI-driven responses for lab reports, medicine scans, and chatbot queries. Currently implemented as the `sendToLLM` function in `server.js`. |
| **server.js** üöÄ       | The core server file containing all backend logic, including Express.js setup, API routes (login, register, lab report, medicine, chatbot), JWT authentication, file uploads with Multer, OCR with `llama-ocr`, PDF parsing, and PostgreSQL integration. Houses the full implementation of database setup, prompt generation, and LLM handling. |

**Note**: While described as separate modules for clarity, `dbSetup.js`, `promptManager.js`, and `llmHandler.js` are currently part of `server.js`. Future refactors may split them into dedicated files.

## API Link üîó

To enable the backend‚Äôs AI-powered features, including OCR for lab reports and medicine scans and AI-driven responses via Meta Llama, you need a Together AI API key and the Render deployment URL. Below are the steps to obtain them:

### Obtaining the Together AI API Key üîë
The backend uses `llama-ocr` for OCR processing (e.g., extracting text from lab reports and medicine images) and `Meta Llama for LLM calls` (e.g., generating summaries and chatbot responses), both powered by Together AI.
1. **Sign Up/Log In**: Visit [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) and create an account or log in.
2. **Access API Keys**: Navigate to your account settings or dashboard, and find the API key section (typically under "API Keys" or "Developer Settings").
3. **Generate Key**: Create a new API key. Copy it immediately, as it may only be displayed once.
4. **Secure the Key**: Store the key securely (e.g., in your `.env` file as `TOGETHER_API_KEY`). Do not commit it to version control or share it publicly.
5. **Add to Environment**: Update your backend‚Äôs `.env` file with:
   ```env
   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
   ```
   This key enables both OCR processing via `llama-ocr` and LLM interactions for lab report summaries, medicine insights, and chatbot responses.

### Accessing the Render Deployment URL üåê
The backend is deployed on Render, and the deployment URL serves as the base for API requests.
1. **Log In to Render**: Access your Render account at [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com).
2. **Select Service**: In the Render dashboard, locate your backend service (e.g., `niramaya-ai-backend`).
3. **Copy URL**: Find the public URL provided by Render (e.g., `https://niramaya-ai-backend.onrender.com`). This is typically displayed in the service‚Äôs overview or settings.
4. **Use in Frontend**: Configure your frontend‚Äôs `.env` file with the Render URL (e.g., `VITE_API_URL=https://niramaya-ai-backend.onrender.com`) for API requests.
5. **Test the API**: Verify the URL by sending a request to the wakeup endpoint:

**Note**: Replace `https://niramaya-ai-backend.onrender.com` with your actual Render URL. Keep API keys and URLs secure to prevent unauthorized access.

## Database Setup on Render üóÑÔ∏è

To host the Niramaya AI backend‚Äôs PostgreSQL database on Render, follow these steps to create a database instance and configure the connection. This ensures your backend can store user data and activities securely in the cloud.

1. **Log In to Render**: Access your Render account at [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com). Sign up if you don‚Äôt have an account.
2. **Create a PostgreSQL Instance**:
   - Click **New** > **PostgreSQL** in the Render dashboard.
   - **Name**: Enter a name (e.g., `niramaya-ai-db`).
   - **Database**: Specify a database name (e.g., `niramaya`).
   - **User**: Optionally set a username (defaults to a random one if blank).
   - **Region**: Choose a region matching your backend service (e.g., Oregon for consistency).
   - **PostgreSQL Version**: Select version 15 (recommended for `server.js` compatibility).
   - **Plan**: Choose the **Free** tier for development (note: free databases expire after 90 days and are limited to one per account) or a paid plan for production.
   - **Storage**: Set initial storage to 1 GB (adjustable later).
   - Click **Create Database**. Wait for the status to update to **Available** (takes a few minutes).
3. **Obtain the Database URL**:
   - Navigate to your database‚Äôs page in the Render dashboard (e.g., `niramaya-ai-db`).
   - Scroll to the **Connections** section.
   - Copy the **Internal Database URL** (e.g., `postgres://user:password@dpg-xxx.oregon-postgres.render.com/niramaya`), as it‚Äôs optimized for Render services in the same region.
4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - For local testing, update your backend‚Äôs `.env` file with:
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL=your_render_internal_database_url
     ```
   - For production, go to your backend service in the Render dashboard (e.g., `niramaya-ai-backend`):
     - Navigate to the **Environment** tab.
     - Add a new environment variable: `DATABASE_URL` = `your_render_internal_database_url`.

**Note**: The free tier expires after 90 days, and Render deletes the database unless upgraded. Use the internal URL for backend connections to minimize latency. Secure the `DATABASE_URL` and avoid sharing it publicly.

## Installation and Library Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To set up the Niramaya AI backend locally, follow these steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and configure the environment. The backend is built with Node.js for a robust and efficient API. üöÄ

**Note**: The devDependency `@types/axios` is excluded, as it‚Äôs not used at runtime.

### Installation Steps üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niramaya-ai/niramaya-ai.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd niramaya-ai/backend
   ```

3. **Install Core Dependencies**: Install all required libraries using npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
   This installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`, including `express`, `pg`, `jsonwebtoken`, `llama-ocr`, `pdf-parse`, and others.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
   PORT=4000
   ```
   - Replace `your_postgresql_connection_string` with your PostgreSQL database URL (e.g., from **Database Setup on Render** section).
   - Replace `your_jwt_secret_key` with a secure key for JWT signing.
   - Replace `your_together_api_key` with your Together AI API key (see **API Link** section).
   - Adjust `PORT` if needed (defaults to 4000).

5. **Run the Server**: Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:4000` (or the specified `PORT`).

## Deployment üöÄ

The backend is deployed on **Render** for scalable and reliable hosting. To deploy:
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository. üì§
2. Connect the repository to Render via the Render dashboard. üîó
3. Configure environment variables in Render (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`). ‚öôÔ∏è
4. Deploy the application, and Render will handle the rest. üåê
